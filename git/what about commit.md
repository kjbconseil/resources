# What about commits ?

## Preamble
As usual, if we consider that the best come from the people that practices, we should listen to the community.
But, of course, not folow blindly all what is it written but searching what is good for us and what could work with the team !

## How should I name them ?
Using "as is" https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ 
or an implementation of those rules.
Usually, that should be enough.

## How big or short, they should be ?
It depends ðŸ™‚ : The rule is there is no rule !
The more important thing you should commit regularly : hourly if possible.
